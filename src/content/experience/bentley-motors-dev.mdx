During my time as a Junior Developer at Bentley I was able to complete a Level 4 Higher Apprenticeship in Software Development, whilst being introduced to React, TypeScript and C#.

- Creation and maintenance of web and mobile applications to digitise processes in other areas of the business.
- Creation of the Site Risk Assessment and Seat Reservation applications used to ensure colleague wellbeing.
- Led development of an application to improve internal fleet usage that was later shared within the wider VW Group to the likes of Seat and Skoda.
