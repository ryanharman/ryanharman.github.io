Specialist React/Node developer with additional AWS responsibilities. Worked with Solid.js, Svelte and Laravel across multiple smaller projects. Notable client work:

- ASARM, a React Native application, alongside a custom Next.js CMS, that enables patients with fatigue related conditions to track their activity alongside generating their prescription with input data.
- Xploro, supported in building new features for both API and web portal. Provided architectural support for large scale refactoring in the API. Guided and led incremental TypeScript adoption, update of components to use Radix UI, Tailwind (previously all Bootstrap), and React Query across the React portal.
- Creamfields web, prepared infrastructure for both North/South websites, consisting of automatic image optimisation in CloudFront and auto scaling within AWS Fargate to enable further cost saving and performance.
