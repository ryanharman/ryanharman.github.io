Built and maintained a social media application that aimed to bring users closer to the web using React Native and Laravel. Created our “SDK” product that enabled businesses to allow users to engage with their websites directly whilst also integrating with our app and existing ecosystem for further reach and click-throughs.

- App, a React Native project deployed via fastlane, styled with Tamagui that interacts with a JSON API spec Laravel backend.
- Portal, a Vite based React project, that utilised the same stack as our mobile application in a web focussed way to ensure we met accessibility standards and had no flaws across browsers, specifically targeting Safari and Chrome compatibility.
- SDK, a TypeScript project utilising React and native dom selectors/methods for handling iframes, that enabled us to embed various widgets onto customer websites via iframes to enable customer engagement.
- Internal design system, a cross platform design system built with Tamagui, that functioned across both mobile and web making use of shared interfaces and style tokens. Used across all of our mobile and web applications.
